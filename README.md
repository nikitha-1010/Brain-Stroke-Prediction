# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
To determine if a person is at risk for a brain stroke, a machine learning model is trained. KNN classifier, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Classifier Algorithms are used to train the machine learning model. The method with the highest accuracy is chosen by the model for brain stroke prediction.
